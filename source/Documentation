This file is for notes on the code

Storyline of code:

1   Data-sets:

Available Data      Weather:    50 solar panels of 356 days ranging from 01-01-2015 to 31-12-2015.   > Production / Irradiance
                    Load:       443 homes measured on the day: 02-04-2011                            > Consumption
                    Batteries:  Define market-penetration when building the ABM through MicroGrid()  > Battery
import_csv_dataset.py contains functions to read in datasets to a np.array

2   Microgrid model

Task is to connect the load-matching with control tasks. Load-matching by optimize() has to translate into control parameters
The input/output in power (kWh) is known. Check relation between output in kWh and control parameters.

3   Agents and side-functions

Agents are initialised with a character:
What kind of load do they have?         self.Consumption
What kind of production do they have?   self.PVproduction
What kind of battery is present?        self.BatteryCapacity


4   Optimization function optimize()
